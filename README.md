# Packet Flow Visualizer

## Overview

The "Packet Flow Visualizer" project aims to create a visual representation of the packet flow from students' laptops/desktops (hosts) to external networks outside of the college campus. The project is divided into two key parts: network topology creation and packet flow investigation.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to gain insights into network communication and data packet behavior by analyzing the packet flow within the college campus network. The project focuses on using Cisco Packet Tracer to create a network topology and capture packets using the built-in packet sniffer. By visualizing the packet flow, we can better understand network protocols, routing, and potential network optimizations.

## Key Components

1. Network Topology Creation:
   - Identify college network devices using traceroute and network administrator consultation.
   - Design a network topology using Cisco Packet Tracer to illustrate the network devices, design, and boundaries, showcasing the path from hosts to external networks.

2. Packet Flow Investigation:
   - Configure IPv4 addresses on layer-3 devices within the network topology.
   - Capture packets at different devices (nodes) using Cisco Packet Tracer's built-in sniffer.
   - Analyze the captured packets, focusing on Ethernet and IP headers to understand the packet flow from hosts to external networks.
   - Create a flow diagram visualizing the packet flow for clear representation.

## Prerequisites

- Cisco Packet Tracer (version 8.2.0 or higher) installed on your machine.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open Cisco Packet Tracer and import the provided network topology file.
3. Follow the instructions in the project report to configure IP addresses on layer-3 devices and initiate packet sniffing.
4. Analyze the captured packets and extract information from Ethernet and IP headers.
5. Create the flow diagram using any flow chart creator application, representing the packet flow from hosts to external networks.
